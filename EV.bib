  abstract = {The strategic placement of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) is crucial for the successful adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) and the promotion of sustainable urban transportation. However, existing spatial decision models using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) often stop at generating suitability maps and rely on simplistic or arbitrary site placement methods, such as fixed service radii, without optimizing spatial distribution that overlook inherent uncertainties, limiting the effectiveness of the decision-making process. This study develops an advanced spatial decision model to handle uncertainty and optimize HRS placement in Prague, Czechia. The model integrates multiple methodologies: (i) Utilizing 21 criteria across accessibility, environmental, infrastructural, and socioeconomic dimensions, with criteria weights prioritized using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to manage uncertainty in expert judgments. GIS suitability analysis identified optimal areas, with 18.13\% of Prague classified as highly suitable for HRS deployment. (ii) Implementing Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to optimize site distribution and address uncertainty in HRS placement, proposing 10 optimal locations validated by a Silhouette score of 0.68. (iii) Evaluating model performance through sensitivity analysis, revealing responsiveness to criteria variations. To evaluate and rank the proposed HRS locations, we integrated a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), optimizing the selection process by exploring a wider solution space. Additionally, accessibility analysis assessed emergency response coverage, ensuring efficient response times. This multi-methodological framework ensures a robust, data-driven approach to site selection, optimizing accessibility, minimizing environmental impact, and promoting sustainable urban transportation. It advances strategic infrastructure planning, sets a precedent for integrating advanced analytic techniques to handle uncertainty and automate site selection in spatial decision-making, and is adaptable to diverse urban contexts.},

  abstract = {Electromobility is a key technology to decarbonize transportation and thereby avoid the worst impacts of anthropogenic climate change. To power such vehicles when away from their home or depot, public charging infrastructure is required which can be split into enroute and destination charging. We define the latter as charging events that occur while users are busy with other activities. To fulfill this purpose, chargers need to be placed in locations where people spend time. This paper introduces a novel approach to do so based on a neural network trained on several thousand public charging stations in Germany. Within the training sample, the approach is able to predict how much energy was charged per station and day with an R2 of 0.61 for the training set and a RMSE of 13 kWh/day. Using the network, we predict utilization across urban, suburban and industrial areas in Europe and make those predictions available through an easy-to-use web interface. It is further possible to perform predictions and, thereby, extrapolate the learnings from Germany to any country with sufficient OpenStreetMap data. The introduced holistic methodology with its prediction and visualization phase is a first-of-its-kind by applying large-scale measured charging data to the placement problem while being usable in areas which have not yet rolled out electromobility.},

Their great potential might be also used for population mobility research to identify spatial interactions forming the hierarchical structure of the settlement system. For this purpose, a model of data acquisition and their preliminary analysis was developed. This model represents an effective tool for mapping the mobility behavior of the population. Using the example of Czechia, primary commuting links are identified, which are subsequently analyzed in detail using GIS tools in both desktop and online environments. Therefore, important commuting centers of different hierarchical levels are defined by the volume and nature of spatial interactions. This approach is used as a source of important expertise for the proposals on subsequent administration reform in Czechia. Nevertheless, the entire model is generally transferable, and the entire method of using the geolocation data for mapping the hierarchy within the settlement system can be replicated in other countries as well.},

  abstract = {The rapid rollout of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is critical for enhancing EV penetration and building an efficient e-mobility system. However, research concerning the impact of the built environment on the deployment of public EV charging points (EVCPs) and its spatial variations remains insufficient. To address this gap, an innovative perspective to assess the performance of public EVCP spatial distribution is firstly developed considering service accessibility and capacity. Using multi-source data, including the POI data, second-hand house data and EVCP static data by the end of 2021, multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), GWR and OLS are conducted in the Beijing case study to assess the influence of the built environment and socio-economic characteristics on the distribution of intra-city public EVCPs. Two sets of comparison are conducted, one for EVCPs with different charging powers (AC and DC) and another for those with varying charging capacities, categorized as distributed and centralized EVCPs. MGWR performs better than OLS and GWR statistically with the largest adjusted R2 and lowest AICc and RSS. The results demonstrate an imbalanced and spatially diverse deployment of EVCPs, with DC and distributed EVCPs displaying a clear concentration trend within the densely populated core area. Besides, 9 variables have emerged as statistically significant factors which vary across analysis groups in significance, coefficients, and bandwidths, showing complex interaction mechanism with EVCPs of various locations and attributes. The conclusions provide insights for policymaking aimed at planning and deploying public EVCPs in megacities.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the task of modeling and predicting count data, with an application to traffic counts on selected urban roads in Prague. We investigated the relationship between multiple counts, designating one of them as the target variable (e.g., data from a key road section) and the others as explanatory counts. Defining traffic count data as the number of vehicles passing through a selected road section per unit of time, we use a framework based on Poisson models to develop a progressive methodology, which we compared with existing models. Working with multimodal count data, we propose the following main steps for the methodology: (i) cluster analysis of explanatory counts using recursive Bayesian estimation of Poisson mixtures; (ii) target count model estimation via local Poisson regressions at identified locations, capturing local relationships between target and explanatory counts; and (iii) prediction of target counts through real-time location detection. The algorithm’s properties were first investigated using simulated data and then validated with real traffic counts. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms classical Poisson and negative binomial regressions, decision tree and random forest classifiers, as well as a multi-layer perceptron, in predicting traffic count data across various quality metrics, even for weakly correlated data. Applied to traffic count data, the promising performance demonstrated by the proposed algorithm offers an optimistic vision for traffic prediction and urban planning, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool for enhancing transportation efficiency by optimizing the timing of city traffic lights to improve traffic flow.},

Hence, an efficient deployment strategy of electrical vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is much needed. This study attempts to address the EVSE problem from a microscopic perspective by formulating the problem in two steps: public charging demand simulation and charging station location optimization. Specifically, we apply agent-based modeling approach to produce high-resolution daily driving profiles within an urban-scale context using MATSim. Subsequently, we perform EV assignment based on socioeconomic attributes to determine EV adopters. Energy consumption model and public charging rule are specified for generating synthetic public charging demand and such demand is validated against real-world public charging records to guarantee the robustness of simulation results. In the second step, we apply a location approach – capacitated maximal coverage location problem (CMCLP) model – to reallocate existing charging stations with the objective of maximizing the coverage of total charging demands generated from the previous step under the budget and load capacity constraints. The entire framework is capable of modeling the spatiotemporal distribution of public charging demand in a bottom-up fashion, and provide practical support for future public EVSE installation.},

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to dramatic increase in charging demands that poses great challenges for efficient charging infrastructure rollout and operation. It is crucial to accurately assess charging demand in urban areas to optimize the siting and sizing of charging infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel urban charging load forecasting model for private passenger EVs based on massive operating data of EVs in Beijing. First, the characteristics of travel patterns for private passenger EVs, urban road network, functional area distribution and charging infrastructure distribution within the entire Beijing area are identified. Then a charging load forecasting model that can simultaneously simulate trip chains for EVs is constructed by considering the occupancy states of public charging piles and the interactions among different EVs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed charging load forecasting model is verified based on comprehensive test data. Our findings imply that the number of EVs at recharge and the charging power can be reliably predicted with the accuracy of over 84.73\,\% and 81.92\,\%, respectively. It provides the foundation for optimal charging infrastructure planning and charging scheduling.},
