\chapter{Motivation - Electromobility and Climate Change}



\section{Climate change}

\textit{Climate change and its effect on humanity. And how traditional ICE vehicles are harmfull. But also that it might be controversial. Show pie chart of emmisions. Creates motivation for EVs.}

\textit{What about underdeveloped world}

\section{Electric vehicles}

\textit{Invented in parallel with ICE. Not feasible. But now they are. Has same birth pains as ICE. Need infrastructure. How they are greener. Show their increase.}

\section{EU mandate}


\textit{mention EU "law" that forbids production of new ICE vehicles. That sets a hard bureaucratic need on the transition and makes it concrete}

\section{Public Electric Charging Locations}

\textit{Show how chargers look, work. Their types. How lots of areas have no access to private CP. And due to mandated rise in EVs chargers will not be enough.}

\subsection{EV Charging Location Placement problem}

\textit{Writes about how placement of chargers is not cheap. And also its hard to determine which one to place. Also talk about grid scaling and the ability to flatten the electric demand with more strategic placement of chargers. Therefore its really good to have some model with good time resolution.}

\section{Goals of the thesis}

\textit{Writes about what we/i aimed to achieve in this work and what was done}
