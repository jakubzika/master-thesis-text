  abstract = {Mobile positioning is recognised to be one of the most promising new sources of data for the production of fast and cost-effective statistics regarding population and mobility. Considerable interest has been shown by government institutions in their search for a way to use mobile positioning data to produce official statistics, although to date there are only few examples of successful projects. Apart from data access and sampling, the main challenges relate to the spatial interpolation of mobile positioning data and extrapolation of recorded data to the level of the entire population. This area of work has to date received relatively little attention in the academic discussion. In the current study, we compare five different methods of spatial interpolation of mobile positioning data. The best methods of describing population distribution and size in comparison with Census data are the adaptive Morton grid and the Random forest model (R² \textbackslash textgreater 0.9), while the more widely used point-in-polygon and areal-weighted methods produce results that are far less satisfactory (R² = 0.42; R² = 0.35). Careful selection of spatial interpolation methods is therefore of the utmost importance for producing reliable population statistics from mobile positioning data.},

  abstract = {Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) user charging behavior has a significant influence on a distribution network and its reliability. Generally, monitoring energy consumption has become one of the most important factors in green and micro grids; therefore, predicting the charging demand of PEVs (the energy consumed during the charging session) could help to efficiently manage the electric grid. Consequently, three machine learning methods are applied in this research to predict the charging demand for the PEV user after a charging session starts. This approach is validated using a dataset consisting of seven years of charging events collected from public charging stations in the state of Nebraska, USA. The results show that the regression method, XGBoost, slightly outperforms the other methods in predicting the charging demand, with an RMSE equal to 6.68 kWh and R2 equal to 51.9\%. The relative importance of input variables is also discussed, showing that the user’s historical average demand has the most predictive value. Accurate prediction of session charging demand, as opposed to the daily or hourly demand of multiple users, has many possible applications for utility companies and charging networks, including scheduling, grid stability, and smart grid integration.},

To explore potential PHEV energy impacts, a three-part survey instrument collected data from new vehicle buyers in California. We combine the available information to estimate the electricity and gasoline use under three recharging scenarios. Results suggest that the use of PHEV vehicles could halve gasoline use relative to conventional vehicles. Using three scenarios to represent plausible conditions on PHEV drivers’ recharge patterns (immediate and unconstrained, universal workplace access, and off-peak only), tradeoffs are described between the magnitude and timing of PHEV electricity use. PHEV electricity use could be increased through policies supporting non-home recharge opportunities, but this increase occurs during daytime hours and could contribute to peak electricity demand. Deferring all recharging to off-peak hours could eliminate all additions to daytime electricity demand from PHEVs, although less electricity is used and less gasoline displaced.},

The dependence structure between six variables is modelled using a non-parametric copula function. Then an iterative method of conditional distributions with a Bayesian inference is used to generate travel patterns that comply with the uncertainty of the inputs. At each destination a probabilistic charging model is used to translate the travel patterns of the electric vehicles (EVs) into the respective power demand of the vehicles. These synthetic datasets capture the degree of uncertainty of the travel and charging behaviour of EVs (contrary to single realisations) and are scalable to different EV populations (allowing uncertainty reduction effects in large populations). Such charging profiles would be useful to electric vehicle grid integration studies such as aggregated power demand, power systems services and charging optimisation analyses.},

Electrification in the transportation sector has led to technology shifts and rapid deployment of electric vehicles (EVs). The potential increase in stochastic and spatially heterogeneous charging load presents a unique challenge that is not well studied, and will have significant impacts on grid operations, emissions, and system reliability if not managed effectively. Realistic scenario generators can help operators prepare, and machine learning can be leveraged to this end. In this work, we develop generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn distributions of electric vehicle (EV) charging sessions and disentangled representations. We show that this model structure successfully parameterizes unlabeled temporal and power patterns without supervision and is able to generate synthetic data conditioned on these parameters. We benchmark the generation capability of this model with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), and empirically show that our proposed model framework is better at capturing charging distributions and temporal dynamics.},

The increased number of EVs may also bring about some issues concerning energy system structure optimization and efficiency enhancement. User behavior analysis and simulation is an important method to solve these issues. A stochastic model for describing the usage of vehicle is essential to handle simulation models and behavior models. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of EV usage patterns is necessary for the model establishment.

With the large-scale data resource rather than limited samples, we provide some robust statistical results and some multi-dimensional comparative analysis in the paper, which can be applied in large-scale deployment environments and large population cities. The results can also provide information for charging infrastructures construction, gird management, vehicle charging scheduling, and so forth in Beijing and even other metropolises with similar situations.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly considered as a promising solution to tackle climate change impacts, improve air quality, and enhance growth sustainability. This paper proposes a two-step approach for optimally deploying charging points (CPs) by bringing together spatial statistics and maximal coverage location models. CP locations are conceptualised as a spatial point pattern, driven by an underlying stochastic process, and are investigated by using a Bayesian spatial log-Gaussian Cox process model. The spatial distribution of charging demand is approximated by the predicted process intensity surface of CP locations, upon which a maximal coverage location model is formulated and solved to identify optimal CP locations. Drawing upon the large-scale urban point of interest (POI) data and other data sources, the developed method is demonstrated by exploring the deployment of CPs in London. The results show that EV charging demand is statistically significantly associated with workplace population density, travel flows, and densities of three POI categories (transport, retail and commercial). The robustness of model estimation results is assessed by running spatial point process models with a series of random subsets of the full data. Results from a policy scenario analysis suggest that with increasing numbers of charging stations to be planned, optimal CP locations gradually expand to the suburban areas of London and the marginal gains in charging demand covered decrease rapidly.},

This paper finds that the impact of PHEVs on the distribution network can be determined using the following aspects of PHEVs: driving patterns, charging characteristics, charge timing, and vehicle penetration. The impacts that these aspects of PHEVs will have on distribution networks have been measured and calculated by multiple authors in different locations using many different tools that range from analytical techniques to simulations and beyond. While much work has already been completed in this area, there is still much to do.

Our objectives are to incorporate the local constraints of supply and demand on public EV charging stations into facility location models and to compare the optimal locations from three different location models. On the supply side, we analyse the institutional and spatial constraints in public charging infrastructure construction to select the potential sites. On the demand side, interviews with stakeholders are conducted and the ranking-type Delphi method is used when estimating the EV demand with aggregate data from municipal statistical yearbooks and the national census. With the estimated EV demand, we compare three classic facility location models – the set covering model, the maximal covering location model, and the p-median model – and we aim to provide policy-makers with a comprehensive analysis to better understand the effectiveness of these traditional models for locating EV charging facilities. Our results show that the p-median solutions are more effective than the other two models in the sense that the charging stations are closer to the communities with higher EV demand, and, therefore, the majority of EV users have more convenient access to the charging facilities. From the experiments of comparing only the p-median and the maximal covering location models, our results suggest that (1) the p-median model outperforms the maximal covering location model in terms of satisfying the other’s objective, and (2) when the number of charging stations to be built is large, or when minor change is required, the solutions to both models are more stable as p increases.},

While current literature provides charging choices and categorizations of charging behavior, these seem oversimplified and limitedly based on charging data. In this research we provide a typology of charging behavior and electric vehicle user types based on 4.9 million charging transactions from January 2017 until March 2019 and 27,000 users on 7079 Charging Points the public level 2 charging infrastructure of 4 largest cities and metropolitan areas of the Netherlands. We overcome predefined stereotypical expectations of user behavior by using a bottom-up data driven two-step clustering approach that first clusters charging sessions and thereafter portfolios of charging sessions per user. From the first clustering (Gaussian Mixture) 13 distinct charging session types were found; 7 types of daytime charging sessions (4 short, 3 medium duration) and 6 types of overnight charging sessions. The second clustering (Partition Around Medoids) clustering result in 9 user types based on their distinct portfolio of charging session types. We found (i) 3 daytime office hours charging user types (ii) 3 overnight user types and (iii) 3 non-typical user types (mixed day and overnight chargers, visitors and car sharing). Three user types show significant peaks at larger battery sizes which affects the time between sessions. Results show that none of the user types display solely stereotypical behavior as the range of behaviors is more varied and more subtle. Analysis of population composition over time revealed that large battery users increase over time in the population. From this we expect that shifts charging portfolios will be observed in future, while the types of charging remain stable.},

  abstract = {Elektrická vozidla se stávají součástí velkých flotil firemních vozidel. Stále častěji jsou do firemních areálů instalovány nabíjecí stanice. Tato bakalářská práce se zabývá využitím historických dat firemní flotily pro určení vhodné velikosti nabíjecích stanic. V naší práci prozkoumáváme existující publikace zabývající se podobnou tématikou. Na jejich základě navrhujeme metodu pro optimalizaci rozmístění nabíječek pro elektromobily mezi jednotlivé nabíjecí stanice v rámci jednoho areálu. Tuto optimalizační metodu testujeme pro různé množství stanic dostupných k rozmístění. Poslední části je návrh dvou možných scénářů, podle kterých by probíhal přechod flotily z vozidel se spalovacím motorem na elektrická vozidla. Rozmístění stanic testujeme na neznámé nabíjecí poptávce. Výsledky ukazují o přibližně 10\% větší úspěsnost optimalizovaného rozmístění v porovnání s rozmístěním rovnoměrným. Optimalizované řešení nemá problém s neznámou poptávkou a rozdíl mezi jeho výsledky a maximálním možným výsledkem není větší než 3\%.},

  abstract = {Traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. Deep learning models, including convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have been extensively applied in traffic forecasting problems to model spatial and temporal dependencies. In recent years, to model the graph structures in transportation systems as well as contextual information, graph neural networks have been introduced and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a series of traffic forecasting problems. In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source resources for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. We have also created a public GitHub repository where the latest papers, open data, and source resources will be updated.},

Training LLMs to suggest edits directly can be challenging due to the scarcity of rich edit data. To address these problems, we propose neural diffusion models that operate on syntax trees of any context-free grammar. Similar to image diffusion models, our method also inverts “noise” applied to syntax trees. Rather than generating code sequentially, we iteratively edit it while preserving syntactic validity, which makes it easy to combine this neural model with search. We apply our approach to inverse graphics tasks, where our model learns to convert images into programs that produce those images. Combined with search, our model is able to write graphics programs, see the execution result, and debug them to meet the required specifications. We additionally show how our system can write graphics programs for hand-drawn sketches. Video results can be found at https://tree-diffusion.github.io.},

Population surfaces are generated using small area data (enumeration districts or output areas) for each Census from 1971 to 2011 inclusive. The paper details the methods used in the creation of these surfaces, and discusses the rationale behind this approach, arguing that grids represent the most appropriate model for assessing population distributions. Methods for grid creation are tested using pre-existing population grids for Northern Ireland as a benchmark. The method developed is then applied to create population grids for the rest of the UK for 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. The changing population structures of small areas across these five time points are explored here to illustrate the value of this approach. The publically-available data resource – the final product of the ‘PopChange’ project – will facilitate exploration of long-term changes in populations over small areas. The paper argues that maximum advantage could be taken of the ‘big data revolution’ if such data were gridded in a similar way, allowing them to be placed in a longer-term historical context, using tools made available through the PopChange project.},

  abstract = {While the transportation sector is responsible for a growing share of greenhouse gas emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) offer solutions for greener mobility. The proportion of electric vehicles in transportation fleets is increasing, but wider adoption will not be possible without an appropriate charging infrastructure. The deployment of such infrastructure should follow a strategy that considers both the environment in which it is deployed and the behavior patterns of electric vehicle users. If these aspects are not taken into consideration, there is a risk of failing to meet users’ needs and generating additional costs. Here we review the literature on location problems for electric vehicle charging stations. We aim to draw up a comparative overview of approaches that have been used up to 2020 for optimizing the locations of charging infrastructure. We first briefly review the issues raised by the deployment of charging infrastructure, namely technical, economic and user acceptance concerns. We then look at the goals of the infrastructure location models in the literature. Schematically, those goals fall into two categories: minimizing the cost of charging infrastructure for a given level of service, or maximizing the service provided for a given cost. Finally, we focus on the approaches used to achieve these goals. Three categories of approaches are identified: node, path, and tour- or activity-based approaches. We then discuss these approaches in relation to technical, economic and user acceptance factors in order to provide a comprehensive analysis for stakeholders involved in EV charging infrastructure planning. Directions are given for future research to develop models that better reflect the real-world picture.},

The bottom-up sector-based estimation method introduced here contributes to a computational tool under development at The Ohio State University for assisting decision making in energy policy, pricing, and investment. In order to simulate highly-resolved consumption profiles three main modeling steps are needed: modeling the behavior of drivers, generating realistic driving profiles, and simulating energy consumption of different kinds of vehicles. The modeling proposed allows for evaluating the impact of plug-in electric vehicles on the electric grid – especially at the distribution level. It can serve as a tool to compare different vehicle types and assist policy-makers in estimating their impact on primary energy consumption and the role transportation can play to reduce oil dependency.},

Human mobility patterns are estimated by means of census data listing the mobility dynamics of about 700,000 vehicles, the energy demand is estimated by modeling the charging behavior of electric vehicle owners. Here we show that current renewable energy production of Sardinia is able to sustain the commuter mobility even in the theoretical case of a full switch from internal combustion vehicles to electric ones. Centrality measures from network theory on the reconstructed network of commuter trips allows to identify the most important areas (hubs) involved in regional mobility. The analysis of the expected energy flows reveals long-range effects on infrastructures outside metropolitan areas and points out that the most relevant unbalances are caused by spatial segregation between production and consumption areas. Finally, results suggest the adoption of planning actions supporting the installation of renewable energy plants in areas mostly involved by the commuting mobility, avoiding spatial segregation between consumption and generation areas.},

The data was used to study the impact of the uptake of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on electricity distribution networks. Two real networks representing an urban and rural area, and a generic network representative of a heavily loaded UK distribution network were used. The findings show that distribution networks are not a homogeneous group with a variation of capabilities to accommodate EVs and there is a greater capability than previous studies have suggested. Consideration of the spatial and temporal diversity of EV charging demand has been demonstrated to reduce the estimated impacts on the distribution networks. It is suggested that distribution network operators could collaborate with new market players, such as charging infrastructure operators, to support the roll out of an extensive charging infrastructure in a way that makes the network more robust; create more opportunities for demand side management; and reduce planning uncertainties associated with the stochastic nature of EV charging demand.},

Even though the market share of EVs is still comparatively low, there are ongoing considerations for integrating EVs in transportation systems. Along with pushing EV sales numbers, the installation of charging infrastructure is necessary. This paper presents a user- and destination-based approach for locating charging stations (CSs) for EVs—the electric charging demand location (ECDL) model. With regard to the daily activities of potential EV users, potential positions for CSs are derived on a micro-location level in public and semipublic spaces using geographic information systems (GIS). Depending on the vehicle users’ dwell times and visiting frequencies at potential points of interest (POIs), the charging demand at such locations is calculated. The model is mainly based on a survey analyzing the average time spent per daily activity, regional data about driver and vehicle ownership numbers, and the georeferenced localization of regularly visited POIs. Optimal sites for parking and charging EVs within the POIs neighborhood are selected based on walking distance calculations, including spatial neighborhood effects, such as the density of POIs. In a case study in southeastern Germany, the model identifies concrete places with the highest overall demand for CSs, resulting in an extensive coverage of the electric energy demand while considering as many destinations within the acceptable walking distance threshold as possible.},

We find that peak net electricity demand increases by up to 25\% with forecast adoption and by 50\% in a stress test with full electrification. Locally optimized controls and high home charging can strain the grid. Shifting instead to uncontrolled, daytime charging can reduce storage requirements, excess non-fossil fuel generation, ramping and emissions. Our results urge policymakers to reflect generation-level impacts in utility rates and deploy charging infrastructure that promotes a shift from home to daytime charging.},

  abstract = {To prepare for rapid growth in global electric vehicle adoption, grid and policy planners depend on detailed forecasts of future charging demand. In this paper we propose a novel holistic, scalable, probabilistic framework to produce large-scale estimates of electric vehicle charging load for long-term planning that capture real drivers’ charging patterns. Our framework captures the uncertainty and stochasticity in charging demand by taking a graphical modeling approach. It has three core elements: driver groups, charging segment choices, and charging session time and energy requirements. The framework uses hierarchical clustering to group drivers by their charging histories, capturing their heterogeneous behaviors and preferences across different segments or types of charging. The framework uses probabilistic mixture models for each driver group’s sessions to identify the unique charging behaviors observed within each segment. We illustrate its application with a large data set from California, profiling the charging patterns and unique driver clusters it identifies. Using the model knobs representing drivers’ battery capacities, behavior, and segment access we present scenarios for California’s charging demand in 2030 with 8 million passenger electric vehicles. Peak charging demand ranged from 3.3 to 8.7 GW across scenarios. Each was calculated in under 45 s on a laptop computer.},

However, such flexibility is neither well analyzed nor effectively quantified in literature. In this paper we fill this gap and offer an extensive analysis of the flexibility characteristics of 390k EV charging sessions and propose measures to quantize their flexibility exploitation. Our contributions include: (1) characterization of the EV charging behavior by clustering the arrival and departure time combinations that leads to the identification of type of EV charging behavior, (2) in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the charging sessions in each behavioral cluster and investigation of the influence of weekdays and seasonal changes on those characteristics including arrival, sojourn and idle times, and (3) proposing measures and an algorithm to quantitatively analyze how much flexibility (in terms of duration and amount) is used at various times of a day, for two representative scenarios. Understanding the characteristics of that flexibility (e.g., amount, time and duration of availability) and when it is used (in terms of both duration and amount) helps to develop more realistic price and incentive schemes in DR algorithms to efficiently exploit the offered flexibility or to estimate when to stimulate additional flexibility.},

Charging pattern of EVs and its corresponding electrical load pattern may be assessed and quantified by using either a deterministic method or stochastic approach. However, deterministic method does not account for stochastic nature of EV users which affects the load pattern and of stochastic nature of grid condition. Thus, a stochastic method is applied to develop a probabilistic model of EVs charging pattern that takes into account various factors such as vehicle class, battery capacity, state of charge (SOC), driving habit/need, i.e. involving trip type and purpose, plug-in time, mileage, recharging frequency per day, charging power rate and dynamic EV charging price under controlled and uncontrolled charging schemes. The probabilistic model gives EV charging pattern over a period of day for different months to represent the load pattern during different seasons of a year. The presented model gives a rigorous estimation of EV charging load pattern in a distribution network which is considered important for network operators.},

This paper presents a stochastic simulation methodology to generate itineraries and charging load profiles for a population of PEVs based on real-world vehicle driving data. In order to describe the sequence of daily travel activities, we use the trip chain model which contains the detailed information of each trip, namely start time, end time, trip distance, start location and end location. A trip chain generation method is developed based on the Naive Bayes model to generate a large number of trips which are temporally and spatially coupled. We apply the proposed methodology to investigate the multi-location charging loads in three different scenarios. Simulation results show that home charging can meet the energy demand of the majority of PEVs in an average condition. In addition, we calculate the lower bound of charging load peak on the premise of lowest charging cost. The results are instructive for the design and construction of charging facilities to avoid excessive infrastructure.},

This study proposed a heterogeneous spatial–temporal graph convolutional network to predict the EV charging demand at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, we first learned the spatial correlations between charging regions by constructing heterogeneous graphs, i.e., a geographic graph and a demand graph. Then, we used graph convolutional layers and gated recurrent units to extract spatio-temporal features in the observations. Further, we designed a region-specific prediction module that grouped regions based on graph embedding and point of interest (POI) data for prediction. We used a large real-world GPS dataset which contained over 76,000 private EVs in Beijing for model training and validation. The results showed that, compared with recently popular spatio-temporal prediction methods, the proposed model had superior prediction accuracy and steady performance at different scales of regions. In addition, we conducted ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity tests. The results suggested that incorporating the demand graph and geographic graph could help improve model performance.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging demand is an essential input of charging facility location models. However, charging demand may vary across seasons. In response, this paper first provided insights into the seasonal variance in charging demand using a unique GPS trajectory dataset which contained travel, parking, and charging information of 2,658 private EVs in Beijing. The dataset was collected in January, April, July, and October 2018, which were representative months in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Through statistical and spatiotemporal analyses, we found that in winter, EVs got recharged when their state of charge (SOC) was lower: the average SOCs on working days were 51.96\%, 48.39\%, 50.86\%, and 43.50\%, in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. Furthermore, the central urban areas tended to have a higher charging demand in winter. To further explore how the seasonal variance in charging demand may influence infrastructure deployment, we used the classical p-median model to deploy charging facilities with the charging demands in the four seasons, considering the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The results suggested that the seasonal variance did influence the layout of charging facilities under different spatial analysis units (SAUs). The deployment of charging facilities in the central urban areas and outer suburbs tended to be more sensitive to seasonal variance in charging demand. The findings are expected to be useful for charging infrastructure planning in both the transport and power sectors.},

In this paper, three-month real-world travel and charging records of 25,489 electric passenger vehicles in Beijing are utilized to quantitatively study the travel patterns and charging behaviors of electric vehicles and support charging demand prediction. A “multi-level \& multi-dimension” travel and charging characteristic parameters extraction framework is proposed with \textbackslash textgreater60 electric vehicle behavior characteristic parameters extracted from time, spatial, and energy dimensions. Then a two-step GMM and K-means-based clustering model is proposed to cluster the electric vehicle users into six categories with different usage habits, attributes, and characteristics. A trip-chain-simulation-based charging demand prediction model is further established to generate a week-period continuous activities simulation for specific category vehicles, in which the interdependences of travel and charging characteristic parameters are considered to make the trip chain simulation closer to reality. The city charging demands are aggregated from individual charging prediction results at a spatial resolution of 0.46 km and time resolution of 15 min quantitatively; the spatiotemporal aggregation results show that the proposed model can realize high accuracy prediction for real-world charging demands.

  abstract = {Analysis of geospatial data has traditionally been model-based, with a mean model, customarily specified as a linear regression on the covariates, and a covariance model, encoding the spatial dependence. We relax the strong assumption of linearity and propose embedding neural networks directly within the traditional geostatistical models to accommodate non-linear mean functions while retaining all other advantages including use of Gaussian Processes to explicitly model the spatial covariance, enabling inference on the covariate effect through the mean and on the spatial dependence through the covariance, and offering predictions at new locations via kriging. We propose NN-GLS, a new neural network estimation algorithm for the non-linear mean in GP models that explicitly accounts for the spatial covariance through generalized least squares (GLS), the same loss used in the linear case. We show that NN-GLS admits a representation as a special type of graph neural network (GNN). This connection facilitates use of standard neural network computational techniques for irregular geospatial data, enabling novel and scalable mini-batching, backpropagation, and kriging schemes. Theoretically, we show that NN-GLS will be consistent for irregularly observed spatially correlated data processes. We also provide a finite sample concentration rate, which quantifies the need to accurately model the spatial covariance in neural networks for dependent data. To our knowledge, these are the first large-sample results for any neural network algorithm for irregular spatial data. We demonstrate the methodology through simulated and real datasets.},

However, the rapid growth of electric vehicles has caused a series of problems, such as insufficient number of charging stations, uneven distribution, and high cost, which are becoming increasingly serious. In order to solve the above problems, this paper takes Ireland as an example for research. Based on the collection of relevant information, this paper first tries to build a social total cost model, and calculates the total operating cost of charging stations under various distribution conditions. In this model, the total social cost is subdivided into comprehensive economic cost and environmental cost. Economic costs include construction costs and fees, while environmental costs include electricity consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Secondly, this paper established a charging station location optimization model based on genetic algorithm, which simplified the Irish territory into a rectangle with a length of 350 km and a width of 200 km, subdivided it into small squares, and adjusted the correlation coefficient to meet the charging demand. This solution solves the minimization problem of operating cost under the constraints of depreciation period of charging station, power consumption per unit distance of charging station and vehicle charging probability. Finally, in order to determine the factors that may have a significant impact on the total cost of charging stations, we conducted sensitivity analysis and found that the total cost is very sensitive to the number of charging stations and the possibility of EV charging per day.},

  abstract = {EV charging station is a very important link in urban planning, and the design of the position and capacity of charging stations are not only to meet the public demand for traveling, but also to maintain the stability of operation and management in power grid. Considering the non-simultaneity and randomness of the EVs arriving at the charging station, the capacity of EV charging stations is calculated by using queuing theory in this study. This study proposes a model which has considered the EVs' charging requirement, economy, and power grid safety to solve the problem of planning EV charging station. Firstly, determine the location of charging station by traffic satisfaction. Secondly, the EV charging stations' charging capacity is optimized with the minimum cost as the optimization target, with the EV user' waiting time patience limit and the distribution network running safety as the constraint condition. Finally, the service area of charging station is divided by the Voronoi diagram. In this study, a 25\_nodes traffic network with 24\_nodes distribution network underground is modelled in the MATLAB environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition the authors solve the model by the genetic algorithm in MATLAB.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we established a multi-objective model of quantitative prediction and resources allocation of electric-vehicle charging station, based on the American situation. We came up with the priorities for urban and rural development of charging stations and got the density map of charging station in America, which can help the maturity of the electric-vehicle industry. First, we built a model of quantitative prediction of charging stations based on the daily charging demand of Ev and the aggregate demand of charging stations. We used it to calculate the number of public charging stations when all the passenger vehicles turn to electric vehicles. We acquired the current distribution of charging stations according to the urban-rural demarcation standards from relevant scholars, then we get the proportion of urban and rural distribution based on the assumption. Second, we chose the charging demand, charging mode, charging station operating mode, charging station construction goal, charging station service radius, power grid planning, road network planning, land use planning, technology development and policy as influencing factors according to the central theory of three principles. Therefore, this model suits for countries with different population density, geography and wealth distribution. Ultimately, We chose the charging demand and the charging station service radius as the main factor, and we concluded that we should prioritize developing the cities.},
